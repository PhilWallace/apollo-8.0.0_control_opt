   Note\: You'll be required to setup profile before doing anything else. Click
   the dropdown menu to select **Navigation** mode, the HDMap and vehicle you
   want to use. The lists are defined in
   [HMI config file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ApolloAuto/apollo/r3.0.0/modules/dreamview/conf/hmi.conf).

   Note\: It's also possible to change the profile on the right panel of the
   HMI, but just remember to click `Reset All` on the top-right corner to
   restart the system.

6. Start the Modules.

   Click the `Setup` button.

   Go to **Module Controller** tab, check if all modules and hardware are ready.
   (Note\: In your offline environment, the hardware modules such as GPS,
   CANBus, Velodyne, Camera and Radar cannot be brought up.) (Note\: You may
   need to drive around a bit to get a good GPS signal.)
